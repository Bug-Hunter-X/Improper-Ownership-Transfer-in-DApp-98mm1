This repository showcases a common vulnerability in decentralized applications (DApps) built using Solidity: improper handling of ownership transfers.  The `bug.sol` file demonstrates the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.sol` provides a corrected version.  This vulnerability can lead to loss of control over the DApp, allowing malicious actors to exploit it. Understanding and addressing such vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure and reliable DApps.
